User-centric control strategy for home lighting system
Development of a control strategy for managing the home lighting system taking into account the user behaviours (e.g., preferences and user-presence). The inputs for the algorithm will be status of the appliance (on/off) and user-presence (MQTT) events detected by IoT devices. The algorithm will generate as output commands to manage the lighting systems.

Final project for the [Programming for IoT Applications](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/sviluppo.guide.visualizza?p_cod_ins=01QWRBH&p_a_acc=2017&p_lang=EN) course at [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it/)
